I'm software engineer, full stack developer who is passionate to work in cloud platform, open source application development and js based applications. I enjoy working with .net core, angular, react and azure based application and also keep an eye on wordpress, outsystems and umbraco.

My interest in cloud led me to get azure certifications - AZ 900, AZ204 and still looking and learning more.
